## 📖 Overview
**MindCompanion** is a mental health chatbot built to address the growing "support gap" in universities. While 75% of mental health issues begin by age 24, many students hesitate to seek help due to stigma or long wait times. 

This project uses **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash** model to provide instant, 24/7 accessible support using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. It is designed to be a "first line of defense," offering a safe space to vent and learn coping strategies.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Empathetic Conversation:** Tuned specifically for student stressors (exams, social isolation, deadlines).
* **Structured Mood Analysis:** The AI outputs JSON data to track "Intensity Scores" (1-10) and detect user moods.
* **Safety First:** Built-in crisis detection protocols that redirect users to professional helplines if self-harm is mentioned.
* **Actionable Advice:** Suggests bite-sized activities (e.g., "5-4-3-2-1 Grounding," "Box Breathing").

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **LLM:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Google AI Studio)
* **Prompt Engineering:** Custom "System Instructions" for persona definition and safety guardrails.
* **Backend:** Python / Node.js (Update this based on what you actually used)
* **Frontend:** (Mention if you used Streamlit, HTML/CSS, Flutter, or just Console)
